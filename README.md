# YouTube-Subpals-bot
What's this? --- A simple bot to automate the process on SubPals.

SubPals is a website which offers you to like and subscribe 20 youtube videos, and you will get 10 new subscribers (it works).

I created a bot using Python and Selenium that completes the task for us.



REQUIREMENTS: Selenium, Chrome Webdriver.
How to get Selenium? --- Open the cmd and run "pip install selenium"
How to get Chrome Webdriver? --- You can download it from here : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.

At Main.py there are 4 things you need to insert in the appropriate places:
1) Your channel ID.
2) Your channel password.
3) Your email.
4) Your email password.

Then you can run and enjoy with your new subscribers!
